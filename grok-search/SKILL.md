# Grok Search

Node scripts for web search, URL fetch, and lightweight site mapping. Run `npm install` once if dependencies are not installed, then run the scripts directly — there is no MCP server or extension to call.

All commands below assume the current directory is the grok-search root (the directory containing this SKILL.md). Your shell's cwd is often elsewhere: either `cd` to the skill root first, or call the scripts by absolute path — do not run `./scripts/...` from an unverified cwd.

## Choose The Script

Decide before running, by what the user already gave you:

- They gave a URL and asked what it says → `scripts/fetch.js`.
- They named a site but no URL, and want to know what is on it → `scripts/map.js`, then `fetch.js` on the URLs you pick.
- They want current/latest information, or the URL is unknown → `scripts/search.js`.
- The question is about the user's local machine (config files, installed versions, local errors) → inspect local files first; use web search only to interpret what you found, not to discover it.

Do not chain map → fetch → search by default. Run the fewest commands that answer the question. If sub-questions are independent (different sites, unrelated facts), launch the commands in parallel instead of sequentially.

Write search queries as plain keywords. Web search cannot execute code-search operators — `repo:owner/name`, `path:`, `language:` and similar GitHub/grep syntax make the backend thrash through query variants at your expense. To scope a search to GitHub, use `--responses-allowed-domains github.com` plus ordinary keywords instead. Budget roughly 2 searches per question: if two well-formed queries have not surfaced the answer, fetch the most promising URL you already have rather than trying more phrasings.

## Commands

```bash
./scripts/search.js "query"
./scripts/search.js --platform GitHub "query"
./scripts/search.js --extra 10 "query"
./scripts/search.js --no-extra "query"
./scripts/search.js --source-chars 200 "query"
./scripts/search.js --responses-openrouter-engine exa "strict web-only query"
./scripts/search.js --responses-x-search --responses-allowed-x-handles xai,OpenAI "query"
```

```bash
./scripts/fetch.js https://example.com
./scripts/fetch.js --provider direct https://example.com
```

Use `./scripts/fetch.js --max-chars 50000 URL` only for an explicit deep read after the preview shows the page is worth reading.

```bash
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --limit 20
./scripts/map.js --provider direct https://docs.example.com
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --instructions "only API reference pages" --max-depth 2
```

Search is Responses-only. It runs Grok Responses alongside independent Tavily and Firecrawl searches. Tavily is used when its key is configured; Firecrawl works keyless and automatically uses `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` when available. The default combined extra target is 6. Add `--extra 10` only for a broader candidate-source sweep. Extras are never fed into Grok.

If Grok quota is explicitly exhausted, `search.js` may return a visibly marked degraded answer made from raw Tavily/Firecrawl results. Check `diagnostics.degraded` and `diagnostics.grok_error`. Other Grok failures remain errors. `--no-extra` disables this fallback as well as the external searches.

## Reading Results

Each script writes a single JSON object to stdout. On failure it still writes JSON to stdout, a short message to stderr, and exits non-zero.

Check in this order:

- `error` — if present, read `error.message`, `error.code`, `error.preview` if present, and `diagnostics.provider_attempts`. Before retrying, change something: a sharper query, a different `--provider` (fetch/map), or a different `--model` (search). Do not rerun the same command. `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` means the whole command hit its time budget (default 240s; `--deadline N` adjusts it).
- `diagnostics.warnings` and `diagnostics.provider_attempts` — these tell you which providers were skipped, failed, or produced content.
- Search success: read `answer.text`, then `sources.items` (one merged list, capped at 12 by default). Source cards are short and use `snippet`, not `description` or `content`. `sources.omitted > 0` means the list was truncated; the full list is in `sources.raw_path` — read it in chunks only when the visible cards are not enough.
- Search: inspect `diagnostics.grok_endpoint`, `diagnostics.degraded`, `diagnostics.cost_usd`, provider attempts, and each item's `source_type` (`citation` = used in the answer, `searched` = merely visited) before treating sources as evidence.
- Fetch success: read `content.text`. If `content.truncated` is true and the preview is enough, stop. If more is needed, read `content.full_path` in chunks or rerun once with a deliberate larger `--max-chars`.
- Map success: read `urls`, choose the best candidates, then fetch only the few URLs you need.

Search and fetch are intentionally separated. Use search to discover and compare sources, then fetch a specific URL for deep reading. In one research turn, fetch 1-2 URLs by default; do not batch-fetch many pages unless the user explicitly asks.

## Providers And Limits

`fetch.js` provider order for `--provider auto`: Tavily Extract → Firecrawl Scrape → Direct Fetch.
`map.js` provider order for `--provider auto`: Tavily Map → Direct Map.

For search, Tavily requires a key while Firecrawl uses its keyless tier by default. For fetch, missing Tavily means Firecrawl Keyless runs before Direct Fetch. The direct providers do not execute JavaScript, log in, use cookies, parse PDFs, or bypass anti-bot. Direct Map only reads `/sitemap.xml` and same-domain homepage links, ignores `--instructions`, and is limited to `--max-depth 1`.

## Proxy

The scripts automatically use terminal proxy environment variables via undici when present: `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` and lowercase variants. `NO_PROXY` is honored, and loopback hosts are bypassed. Use `GROK_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:7890"` to set a proxy just for this tool, or `GROK_PROXY=off` to force direct connections. If proxy debugging is needed, set `GROK_DEBUG=true`.

If `search.js` returns `GROK_API_URL 未配置` or `GROK_API_KEY 未配置`, the project itself is missing required setup — point the user at `README.md` instead of trying to work around it.

## When To Plan First

For multi-part research, conflicting sources, or anything that needs both site discovery and page content, read `references/planning.md` before running commands.
